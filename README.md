# redditpcsalestracker
An almost-certainly obsolete program to notify user about pc component sales based on the reddit API

Instructions for people who are newish to python:  
  1.  install pipenv using pip in bash/cmd  
  2.  type "install pipenv" with the project directory open  
  3.  type "pipenv run python saletracker.py"  

Expected updates:  
  * support for multiple keywords i.e. "ram" AND "DDR4" AND "3200MHz"  
  * ability to input keywords during operation
  * better notification support  
  * maybe a switch to c#
